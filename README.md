## Hi there 👋 
I am currently a **Lecturer in Media and Communication** at the **University of Winchester (UK)**. I completed my **PhD at the University of Leeds (2022)**, where I examined the role of the **Colombian news media during a peace negotiation (2012-2016)** between the Colombian government and FARC.

## 🔍 Research Interests

- 🕊️ **Media and War / Media and Peace**
- 🗳️ **Political Communication**
- 👨‍💻 **Combining computational methods with qualitative approaches**

## 🛠 Coding & Research Applications

For my **PhD**, I used **R** to **scrape, process, and analyze** a dataset of **17,688 news articles** from: *El Tiempo*, *El Espectador*, *Semana*, and *La Silla Vacía*. 

I applied **Structural Topic Modeling (STM)** to analyze these articles, identifying key themes in the Colombian media coverage.

## 📝 Featured Paper
In one of my papers, [published open access in *Media, War & Conflict* (2025)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17506352241307012), I explored the role that the Colombian media played at the moment of the worst escalation of the conflict during the peace negotiations, drawing on **STM results**, thematic analysis of news, and interviews with politicians and journalists.

## 🚀 Currently Working On
**Exploring new ways to apply computational methods to analyze political discourse online.**

**Expanding my coding skills in Python**🐍, focusing on:
  - 👨‍💻 **Web Scraping** – Using `Selenium`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `Scrapy` for media data collection.
  - 📈 **Text Analysis** – Implementing topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and data visualization techniques.
